This is my first attempt at doing Roy Osherove's string calculator kata http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/

It is also my first pass at doing a Ruby project in RubyMine, and my initial my introduction to github.

So with all these firsts I expect to make a lot of mistakes and learn a lot along the way.
